    <p>
      Hi! I am <strong>Christian Azuero</strong>. I built this project to combine three things I love:
      <em>Capture the Flag (CTF)</em>, <em>Escape Rooms</em>, and blasting <em>Music</em> while working. 
      For me, the first two are thrilling. They push you to think under pressure, collaborate, enjoy, and 
      solve cleverly designed puzzles. The third one is optional depeding of your taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      This site is a space for the <strong>cybersecurity community</strong> to challenge themselves through
      story-driven CTFs. The main focus areas are <strong>GRC</strong> (Governance, Risk & Compliance),
      <strong>Cyber Analysis</strong>, and <strong>Penetration Testing</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you are practicing fundamentals or exploring advanced scenarios, I hope these rooms are both
      fun and educational. See you at the top floor.
